Psalm of New Jersey (Intro Only)
by Marcus Pan

Now my friends it is time to bring you back to the reality of the present time. I know, I originally said this magazine is strictly AD&D/Fantasy, but I couldn't resist placing this little ditty in the hallowed pages of "Legends". Besides, I'm the editorâ€¦

The writer of this fabulous piece is unknown. But I credit its discovery to my friend, Dirk Weber.

So, I end the first issue of Legends with something totally contradictory with what it is based on, but so what...I hope you enjoyed "Legends" Issue 1, and without further adieu, I bring you "Ode to Florio."
