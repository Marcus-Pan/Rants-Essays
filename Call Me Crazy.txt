Call Me Crazy
By Marcus Pan

I admit it. I am a very strange person. When I am having a good time I tend to go crazy. But those that know me laugh at my antics and generally have a good time also. I like being crazy. It's great when you can act a little out of the ordinary and not get a second glance because it's expected of you. If I were to act normal (ieeew), that's when I would get the second glances. Everyone knows I'm crazy. Aren't we all? Why conform? It's boring.

According to some of my friends, I'm the only one with the balls to put out a magazine like this. And to me that's a compliment.

I admit that I'm warped. I admit that I'm nuts. I have no trouble dealing with the fact that I am completely abnormal. You have to be a little nuts to live in this world. This is a land where we drive on parkways and park on driveways. You have to be slightly neurotic to live here.

So go ahead...call me crazy. But never call me normal.
